# Russian_CyberThreats_Yara

With the rising conflict in the East between Russia and Ukraine, we at Trellix have also seen an increase in cybercrime activity, specially related to known Russian Groups and related Malware threats. With that in mind, we have been hard at work on providing assistance with the detection and dissemination of information related to these cyber threats. Our work would not have been easy, or perhaps even possible, without the help of the community and its researchers which make their work publicly available. For this, we thank the whole community for its hard work, willingness to share, and fight for a better cyber world.

In this repository, Â we have aggregated many yara rules from various public sources, including our own, and make it available to organizations and individuals alike, to help combat these emerging threats. #ShieldsUp
